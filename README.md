# Hacker News text only

[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) text only, static site reskin, with dark and light mode

## todo

- make comments stop loading at a certain depth and provide a link to view the rest (as the real site does)
- make page jump to comment from url hash (currently jumps to top-level parent of last hovered comment due to issue with detecting which comment is being hovered)
- make comments load depth-first (low priority, currently loads with no preferred order which works fine)
- fix display of code blocks
- fix local storage capacity issue
